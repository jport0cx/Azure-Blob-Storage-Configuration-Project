# Azure-Blob-Storage-Configuration-Project
Objective: I Configured and secured Azure Blob Storage with private access, including implementing connection strings, SAS tokens, and application settings for a web application tintegration. 
Storage Account Creation and Configuration: Created a new storage account with the following specifications: Name: sa46251560 Performance - Tier: Standard Replication - Type: Locally-Redundant Storage (LRS). Added a private blob container named private and set the public access level to Private to ensure restricted data access.
Connection String and Key Management: Retrieved and utilized the Key1 Access Key and Connection String for secure storage account access. Integrated the connection string into a custom configuration named storageConnection for the associated web app.
Blob Storage Management:                                                                                                                                                               Uploaded image files to the private container with specific configurations: First file: 64 KiB, Hot access tier. - Second file: 256 KiB, Cool access tier.                          Following that action I Applied Blob index tags to categorize files: First file: source/PrivateFiles. - Second file: source/ArchivePrivateFiles.                                    Verified secure storage and access of files via URLs and SAS tokens.
Secure Access with SAS Tokens:                                                                                                                                                    Generated an 8-hour Shared Access Signature (SAS) token for the private container.                                                                                                Successfully verified blob file access via SAS links while ensuring direct URL access without a SAS token failed.
Web App Integration:                                                                                                                                                             Configured application settings for the web app (wa46256174) with the following properties:                                                                             StorageAccountName: sa46256174                                                                                                                                               StorageAccountKey: Key1 access key                                                                                                                                           StorageAccountSAS: SAS token                                                                                                                                                         
Testing and Validation: Ensured private blobs were inaccessible without a SAS token.  Verified successful retrieval of image files using SAS-authenticated URLs. Confirmed proper integration of storage settings into the web app for dynamic blob access. Verified the web app's functionality to retrieve and test blob containers and files using the configured settings.
Tools and Skills Used:
Azure Portal: Storage account creation, blob configuration, SAS token generation.
Azure Blob Storage: File uploads, index tagging, and access management.
Web App Configuration: Application settings and connection string integration.
Security Practices: Implemented private access levels and SAS tokens to ensure secure data management.

Overview: Demonstrated expertise in configuring secure Azure Blob Storage, integrating storage with web applications, and enforcing access control mechanisms.
